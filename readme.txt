== Description ==

Twitgets takes the Twitter Badges code and wraps them in Wordpress plugin so you can just "plug them in".
No More editing of PHP or HTML files.

There are four Twitgets currently available. Download and save to your wordpress/wp-content/plugins/widgets directory.

   1. Twitter Flash - uses the flash badge code from Twitter which displays your last Twitter post.
   2. Twitter Friends - which shows your friends Twitter Images with links to their posts using Twitter’s friends badge.
   3. Twitter Party - shows your friends postings using Twitter’s party flash badge code.
   4. Twitter JavaScript - a non-flash version of Twitter Flash using Twitter’s JavaScript badge.

== Installation ==

-- Requirements --

I used the Sidebar Widgets plugin developed by the folks at Automattic.com. It adds a nice “Sidebar Widgets” menu in the 
Wordpress Presentation menu for easy management of your sidebar widgets. Please follow the download and installation 
instructions at their site to install and activate their plugin. After you have it activated, you will be able to install 
and configure these Twitgets.

You can get the Sidebar Widgets plugin at http://svn.wp-plugins.org/widgets/trunk/

-- Twitgets Plugin Installation Instructions --

Download and save the Twitget files to your wordpress/wp-content/plugins/widgets directory.

1. Login to your Wordpress administration page and click on the “Plugins” link to get to the plugin activation page. 
You should see the new plugins listed. Click on the “Activate” link next to each one you wish to use. 

2. Click on the “Presentation” link of your Wordpress administration page menu, then click on the “Sidebar Widgets” menu 
link to get to the Sidebar Widgets administration page. You should see the available widgets at the bottom.

3. Drag and drop the widgets you choose to use from the “Available Widgets” pane to the “Sidebar1″ pane. 

4. Now all we need do is configure each widget with your personalized settings. Click on the configuration pane link to 
open the configuration window. Below are the configuration details for each Twitget I have made. You will of course 
require your Twitter user name and Twitter id. To get your Twitter id, go to your twitter page (for example mine would be 
http://twitter.com/RCOZ). At the bottom of your twitter messages you will see a link for “RSS Feed”. Pass your mouse over 
it or click on it to see the URL it takes you to. It should end with #######.rss. That ######## is your Twitter id. 
(For example mine is 2898541).

5. Follow the configuration directions in the configuration instructions (Other Commnents) for the Twitgets plugins you wish to use.
